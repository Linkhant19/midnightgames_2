# midnightgames_2

This is the second game from my midnight games series where I create a game from scratch on a sleepless night. Today's game is inspired by the Chrome dinosaur game and color switch game. 

Creation time: 4/17/2024 midnight --> 4/18/2024

How to Play: 

Press 'spacebar' to change colors. You must have the same color to pass through the gates. Have fun!
